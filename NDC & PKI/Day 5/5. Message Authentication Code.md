### **Why is MAC Used?**

- MAC ensures **data integrity** and **authentication** between two parties communicating over a network.
- It prevents tampering of the message by verifying that the message was not altered in transit.
- **Requirement**: Both parties must share a **symmetric key**.

### **Technical Explanation:**

- A MAC function generates a code (MAC) by applying a **secret key** to a message.
- The receiver uses the same secret key to verify the authenticity and integrity of the message.

### **Types of MAC:**

#### **1. Hash MAC (HMAC):**

- **How It Works:**
    
    1. The sender concatenates the **key** with the message content and calculates a **hash value**.
    2. The calculated hash value (HMAC) is sent along with the message.
    3. The receiver:
        - Concatenates their copy of the **key** with the received message.
        - Calculates a hash value and compares it with the received HMAC.
    
    - If the values match, the message is authentic and intact.
- **Key Points:**
    
    - Provides **data integrity** but not **authentication**.
    - Assumes only the sender and receiver have the shared key.

#### **2. CBC-MAC:**

- Another type of MAC based on block ciphers (e.g., AES in Cipher Block Chaining mode).
- Works similarly but uses cryptographic algorithms for more secure key-based authentication.

## **Digital Signature**

### **What is a Digital Signature?**

- A **digital signature** ensures both **data integrity** and **authentication** using public-key cryptography.
- The **hash value** of the message is encrypted using the sender’s **private key**, and the receiver verifies it using the sender’s **public key**.

### **Example: Tinku and Pinki Communicating**

1. **Keys Setup:**
    
    - **Tinku** has a private key and a public key.
    - **Pinki** has her own private key and public key.
    - Both share their **public keys** with each other.
2. **Tinku Sends a Message:**
    
    - Tinku creates a message **M1**.
    - Calculates the hash of the message (**H1**).
    - Encrypts **H1** using his **private key** to generate the digital signature.
    - Sends the **M1** (message) and the **digital signature** to Pinki.
3. **Pinki Verifies the Message:**
    
    - Pinki decrypts the digital signature using Tinku’s **public key**, obtaining the original hash value (**H1**).
    - She recalculates the hash value for the received message **M1**.
    - If both hash values match:
        - The message is **authentic** (ensured by Tinku’s private key).
        - The message **integrity** is verified (not tampered in transit).

### **Comparison: MAC vs. Digital Signature**

|Feature|**MAC**|**Digital Signature**|
|---|---|---|
|**Key Type**|Symmetric Key|Asymmetric Key (Private/Public)|
|**Authentication**|Assumes shared key provides authentication|Ensures authentication using private key|
|**Integrity**|Ensures integrity|Ensures integrity|
|**Use Case**|Faster, simpler for trusted parties|More secure for untrusted environments|
