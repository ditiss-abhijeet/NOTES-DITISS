### **Introduction to Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

- An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** monitors network traffic and allows only authorized packets into the system.
- The definition of intrusion varies across organizations and is determined by their respective policies.
- **Authorized** and **unauthorized** traffic is also defined by the organization's specific rules.

### **What is SNORT?**

- SNORT is an **Open Source Intrusion Detection System**.
- It can operate in multiple modes:
    - **Packet Capturing or Sniffing Mode**: Used to verify SNORT's installation and functionality.
    - **NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) Mode**: For detecting intrusions and analyzing network traffic.
    - **Packet Logging Mode**: Logs network packets to a disk for later analysis.

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Install SNORT** in the `C:\` folder (recommended for easier setup).
2. Install **WinPcap**, a library required to run SNORT.
3. Add the **SNORT folder** to the Windows Defender exclusion list.
4. Verify WinPcap installation via the **Add or Remove Programs** section.
5. Open **Command Prompt** as an administrator and navigate to `C:\Snort\bin`.
6. Run the command:
    
    ```shell
    snort -W
    ```
    
    This lists available network interfaces, confirming SNORT's installation.
7. Ensure **7-Zip** is installed for extracting rule files.
8. Navigate to the folder containing `snortrules-snapshot-2923.tar.gz`.
    - Right-click and choose `7-Zip > Extract Here`.
    - If you donâ€™t see the `7-Zip` option, select **More Options** after right-clicking.
9. Right-click the extracted `.tar` file and select `7-Zip > Extract Files`.
    - Choose `C:\Snort` as the destination folder.
    - In the options, select **Overwrite without prompt**.
    - Also uncheck the checkbox.
1. Resolve any errors shown during setup and apply extra changes suggested in error logs to avoid future issues. The errors resolution and extra changes are mentioned below.

### **Key Commands and Usage**

#### **Running SNORT**

- Always run SNORT as an **administrator**. (Run `cmd` as administrator and navigate to the `C:\Snort\bin`) then start using the `snort` commands:
- Default SNORT executable path:
    
    ```plaintext
    C:\Snort\bin\snort.exe
    ```
    
#### **List Network Interfaces**

- Use the following command to list interfaces supported by SNORT:
    
    ```shell
    snort -W
    ```
    
- Use this along with:
    
    ```shell
    getmac /fo csv /v
    ```
    
    This retrieves MAC addresses of network adapters, helping identify the correct interface.

#### **Capture Packets**

- To select a specific interface (e.g., interface 4):
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4
    ```
    
- Stop packet capturing:
    - Press `CTRL + C`.

#### **Additional Flags**

- To see **application layer data**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -d
    ```
    
- To see **data link layer data**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -e
    ```
    
- For **verbose output**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -v
    ```

### **Rules in SNORT**

- SNORT uses **rules** to detect known threats, similar to how antivirus software uses signature files.
- Initially, the **rules folder** is empty.
- You can:
    - Download pre-defined rule files from SNORT developers.
    - Create custom rule files tailored to specific needs.

#### **Important Note**

- Add SNORT rule files to the **Windows Defender exclusion list** to avoid interference.

#### **`browser-ie.rules` File**

- This file contains rules related to Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. This file is automatically deleted if you do not add the `Snort` folder to the exclusion list of Windows Defender.
