1. **Quantum Computers or Quantum Computing**  
    Quantum computing uses quantum-mechanical phenomena (like superposition and entanglement) to perform operations on data, enabling faster problem-solving for specific tasks like cryptography and optimization.
    
2. **OSI Model**  
    A 7-layer architecture used to standardize communication in networks:
    
    - **Application**, **Presentation**, **Session**, **Transport**, **Network**, **Data Link**, and **Physical** layers.
3. **ACL in Routers**  
    Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to filter and control traffic in routers, functioning similarly to firewalls by allowing or denying traffic based on specified rules.
    
4. **What is a Payload?**  
    The payload is the actual data carried by a packet, excluding headers and metadata. It is the core content delivered from source to destination.
    
5. **Kernel Space vs. User Space Modules**
    
    - **Kernel Space:** Code that runs directly in the operating system’s core (e.g., drivers, netfilter).
    - **User Space:** Code that runs outside the OS kernel, in the user environment (e.g., iptables).
6. **3-Way Handshake in TCP Protocol**  
    **Connection Establishment:**
    
    - Client → **SYN** → Server
    - Server → **SYN-ACK** → Client
    - Client → **ACK** → Server  
        **Connection Termination:**
    - Initiator → **FIN** → Receiver
    - Receiver → **ACK** + **FIN** → Initiator
    - Initiator → **ACK** → Receiver
7. **CrypTool**  
    A tool used for learning, analyzing, and performing cryptographic operations like encryption, decryption, and hashing.
    
8. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
    Converts human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
    
9. **Mail Server**  
    A server that handles email sending (SMTP), receiving (POP3, IMAP), and storage for users, enabling email communication.
