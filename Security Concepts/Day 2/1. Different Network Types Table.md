## **Summary**
### **Internal Network**:

- The base machine does not have connectivity to the VMs in an internal network unless explicitly configured.
- Only VMs (e.g., VM1 and VM2) can communicate with each other as they are part of the same isolated internal network.

---

### **Bridge Networking**:

- In Bridged Networking, all devices (base machine and VMs) are on the same physical network.
- This allows them to ping each other and access the internet.

---

### **Host-Only Networking**:

- In Host-Only Networking, the base machine and VMs can communicate with each other but cannot access the internet.
- This setup ensures connectivity within the host-only network.

---

### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:

- NAT allows all VMs to share the base machineâ€™s internet connection.
- While VM-to-VM communication works, pinging between the base machine and VMs may not always be possible, depending on the configuration.

---

### **NAT Network**:

- In a NAT Network, VMs can communicate with each other and access the internet via NAT.
- Communication with the base machine is not guaranteed unless explicitly configured. This setup often isolates the base machine from the VMs.
